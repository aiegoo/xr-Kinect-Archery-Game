The aim of the game is to hit as many targets as possible. Using the Kinect makes it easier to play, just how you would use a bow and arrow in real life - pick up an arrow, attach it to the bow and pull the string back to shoot.

Beginning with a pre-made demo in Kinect Studios, the game went from a simple head tracking and character motion mapping demo, to a full-fledged Archery range with Targets, a Scoring System, and Trajectory Prediction of the projectile.
